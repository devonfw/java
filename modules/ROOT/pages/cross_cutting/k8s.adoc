= Kubernetes (k8s)

Kubernetes(k8s) is an open source system for link:https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-container-orchestration[container orchestration]. Kubernetes allows the automatic management of containers. Learn more about Kubernetes link:https://kubernetes.io/de/[here].


== Setup 
[NOTE]
====
link:https://www.docker.com/pricing/faq/[Docker Desktop] is no longer free for large companies. Please use Rancer Desktop instead. 
====
* Install Rancher Desktop with the link:https://github.com/devonfw/ide[DevonIDE]
* Choose a container Runtime containerd or dockerd(moby)
** containerd is using the link:https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl[nerdctl]
** dockerd is using the link:https://github.com/docker/cli[docker cli]

== Commands

Nerdctl is a "docker-compatible" cli tool for the containerd runtime. It mimics the docker interface in most cases. For the local development, the only difference is shown below.

=== Building an image for locale k8s

=====
Docker::
+
--
Create a locale image from Dockerfile for local kubernetese cluster
----
docker build -t image_name .
----

Create objects in the cluter from a configuration file
----
kubectl apply -f configFile.yaml

== Using Yaml Config files

Yaml files define the structure of a kuberentes application. Each link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/[object] inside the cluster can be described with a yaml file.
Kuberentes has lots of different objects. To get startet check out the following:

- link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/[Deployment]
- link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/[Service]
- link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/configmap/[ConfigMap] 
- link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/[Secrets]

To create an object inside the cluster run
----
kubectl apply -f configFile.yaml
----


== Using Helm

link:https://helm.sh/[Helm] is a commandline tool to help define, install, and upgrade kubernetes applications by automating the deployment of objects.

To get started with helm view this link:https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/getting_started/[guide]
