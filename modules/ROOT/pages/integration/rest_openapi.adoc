= Open Api Generator

OpenApi is a specification to describe restful service endpoints in a human and computer readable format.

With the help of a generator, server and client code can be created from the Api definition.
This will help to build projects more Api driven, faster, consistent and in a design first approach.

- For the client-side, it's easier to send requests to the Api by using a generated Api client
- For the server-side, stubs are generated as interfaces to implement


== Generator to use

There are different types of generators, it is suggested to use the link:https://openapi-generator.tech/[OpenApi Generator].

It's sugessted to use the link:https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/plugins/[maven/gradle plugin version] for the client and server. For the client, there is also a link:https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/installation[cli tool].

== Setup

Create an link:https://swagger.io/specification/[openapi.yaml] file from the Api and move it into the `main/resources` folder.

link:https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/plugins[Configure] the openapi generator maven plugin inside the `pom.xml`.


=== Use generated as package name

- The code generated for the `server` should be located under <root-package>.generated.api 

- The code generated for the `client` should be located under <root-package>.generated.client 

=== Before generating, choose the underlying httpClient library
When generating a client, the client encapsulates the HttpClient library, making it easy to exchange. The library can be set by changing the `library` option inside the plugin configuration.

Some minor changes need to be done when changing the library.
For link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html[native Java library], the method for changing the server path is `updateBaseUri`.
For other libraries, it is `setBasePath`. When switching, this needs to be changed. See the example for the details.

Dependent on the library, error handling can be different.

== For client-side

A detailed guide on how to use the generated client code can be found link:https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-rest-client-swagger-codegen#2-expose-api-classes-as-spring-beans[here]

=== Configure The APIClient and Specific clients in a Configuration Bean

The ApiClient should be configured in a Configuration Bean named {[ApiName]}Config

It is possible that the server url is already set inside the openapi.yaml file.
You can set/overwrite the server path of the Api inside the application.properties using the configuration bean. 

For different http libraries, the configuration bean has to be changed.

== For server-side

A detailed guide on how to use the generated server code can be found link:https://www.baeldung.com/java-openapi-generator-server/[here]

The content type for the response is defined inside the openapi file.
If there are multiple response types and xml should be used as default, add the following in the plugin configuration.
----
<singleContentTypes>false</singleContentTypes>
<withXml>true</withXml>
