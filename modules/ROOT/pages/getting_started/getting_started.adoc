= Getting started

The basic way of working with devon4j:

* [ ] Download Spring or Quarkus from the official websites
** https://start.spring.io/
** https://code.quarkus.io/
* [ ] Establish the xref:../cross_cutting/coding_conventions.adoc[coding conventions] in the team
* [ ] Align the architecture of the new service with an xref:../architecture/layered_architecture.adoc[architecture pattern]
* [ ] Prepare the xref:../cross_cutting/exceptions.adoc[exception handling]
* [ ] Configure the service for xref:../cross_cutting/logging.adoc[logging]

Specialized instructions can be found in the child pages of this guide.

The documentations contain examples that show implementations and can be used to copy and paste code snippets into the own project.
